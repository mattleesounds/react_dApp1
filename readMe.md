Update: (2/27/22) Truffle migration successful, but problem with node.js modules
when implementing server. Plan is to reinstall node, React, and Truffle and build again.

Update: (3/3/22) Have been trying for the past few days to get node modules to work correctly. There seems to be some kind of problem with accessing node modules, or with those node modules to communicate properly with truffle. I think I will need to spend more time getting familiar with node and truffle in order to really understand what is going on. It is likely a very easy fix. I have tried many different versions of node at this point. It seems important to understand exactly how all of these files are accessing eachother.
